"""Replaceable miner-owned methods (role "candidate").

A method here is written from the public contract alone (``institutional_v02.contracts``,
``canonical``); tests/test_separation.py proves by import graph and at runtime that this
package never reaches an evaluator-only module. Methods register under (class_id, method_id)
and are bound to a class with ``classes.with_candidates``. No registered method is a chain
participant until a uid is assigned.
